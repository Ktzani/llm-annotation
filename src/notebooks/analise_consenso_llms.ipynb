         "We have lived in Phoenix almost 8 years and been dying to try Bianco's but wait is always way too long  Recently went to newly opened location and got in within an hour only because we wanted to sit inside (heating up in the valley)  Seating is limited so once it gets really hot I suspect the wait might get a little longerOK the food: appetizer free because of the wait nice touch we had the anti-pasto which was not at all what we expected yet thouroughly delightful Fresh beets baby carrots cheese Sopprosetta and fennel - very flavorful  Pizza was good the crust is really what makes it great toppings were ok my daughter prefers traditional pepperoni and sausage to the local schreiners sausage and supressetta (don't know how to spell)  Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean cream was an excellent end to a great meal  This will probably not be a frequently visited restaurant due to the wait times but we will definately come back sooner than eight years.\n",
