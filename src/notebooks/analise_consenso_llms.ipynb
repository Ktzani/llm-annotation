One hundred and nine women underwent 110 TAC-WBC scans. One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis. Twenty-six women had appendicitis. 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery. The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%). nine of whom had appendicitis. Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology. There were 16 true positives. 5 false positives. 36 true negatives. and 1 false negative. The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%. and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%. The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women. The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC scan is its high indeterminate rate.\n",

Along with incomplete neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. presynaptic markers of the EAA system are immature in the developing brain; however. postsynaptic EAA system activities. particularly of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate receptors. are transiently enhanced early in life. This transient enhancement is presumably beneficial to the immature brain because physiologic activation of the EAA system plays a critical role in plasticity of early learning and morphogenesis. At the same time. this transient hypersensitivity renders the immature brain vulnerable to pathologic excitation of the EAA system (excitotoxicity) as observed during neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.\n",

Brain death was determined by absence of brainstem function. including loss of all cranial nerve responses and sustained apnea (PCO2 greater than 60 torr) for 48 hours with confirmation of findings by an outside consulting child neurologist. The initial examinations of these 12 infants revealed spontaneous movements and startle myoclonus (12). suck. root. and gag responses (7). increased tone (8). deep tendon reflexes (9). absent pupillary responses (9). absent oculocephalic and corneal responses (6). absent auditory/Moro responses (7). and nonvisualization of the optic nerve (8). Mild depression of neurologic function occurred during the first several days of life; subsequently. the infants' responses were easier to elicit and more sustained. Only 2 infants met the clinical criteria for brain death. Neuropathologic findings indicated that observed complex motor responses were not based upon cortical activity because no infant had a normally-formed cerebrum. Brainstem neuronal activity may have accounted for these motor responses in some patients but even at this level neurons were scanty or absent. Our findings suggest that. although rare. clinical brain death can be determined in liveborn anencephalic infants; ophthalmologic and otologic developmental abnormalities may confound examination of cranial nerve function; and absence of cortical neurons supports the widely held opinion that these infants do not experience sensation.\n",

More than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day of ACTH was needed for a good initial response of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities. The relationship between the dose of ACTH and long-term prognosis was investigated in 29 patients. There was no relationship between the daily or total ACTH dosage. provided the dose was greater than 0.015 mg (0.6 IU)/kg/day. and the outcome of seizures and electroencephalographic abnormalities; however. ACTH 0.04-0.06 mg (1.6-2.4 IU)/kg/day and a total ACTH dose of 1.1-1.5 mg (44-60 IU)/kg resulted in better mental development than smaller doses of ACTH. Side effects of ACTH increased with dosage. Too small or too large a dose of ACTH does not lead to better mental development. The proper dose of ACTH should be used with careful attention to potential side effects.\n",

In rolling. trunk rotation and elbow support were difficult for the most severely diplegic children. When sitting. most patients had a between-heel sitting pattern in which the thighs were adducted and the knees were flexed. When crawling. the reciprocal thigh movements were insufficient and accompanied by lateral bending of the trunk in many patients. In the more impaired patients. the thighs supported the weight in flexion and did not move reciprocally.

Both strains had higher affinity to the epithelial cells of children than to those of adults. In children. the adherence was significantly greater in patients with otitis media with effusion than in normal subjects. Secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions was found to have antibody activity against the bacteria. Adherence of both bacteria was significantly smaller in the group having secretory IgA antibody activity than in the group having no activity. These results suggest that bacterial adherence to the nasopharynx may play an important role in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in children. and that secretory IgA in nasopharyngeal secretions may be related to the decrease of adherence.\n",

Indications, technique, and complications, Tissue expansion is indicated in the reconstruction of various defects of the head and neck in instances where there is inadequate adjacent tissue to allow either primary closure of the defect or repair with a local flap. It may also be indicated in instances where repair of a defect by an alternative method such as a local. regional. or distant flap will result in an unacceptable donor or recipient site deformity. Although tissue expansion is simplistic in concept. it does require judgment and indepth preoperative planning to ensure optimal results. The complication rate is high for tissue expansion in the head and neck. particularly in the cheek and neck area. Despite the frequency of complications. in the vast majority of cases the intended reconstruction is successful.\n",

A case-control investigation of risk factors, Unlike most upper aerodigestive tract cancers. salivary gland cancers are relatively infrequent. are characterized by a diversity of histologic subtypes. and have never been etiologically associated with tobacco exposure. We present the results of a case-control study of risk factors for these cancers. with risk estimates derived from self-administered comprehensive risk-factor questionnaires distributed to patients at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Houston. Cases were 64 patients with histologically confirmed salivary gland cancer. Control subjects. randomly selected from the same patient population excluding patients with cancer of the head and neck or nonmelanoma skin cancer. were frequency-matched to the cases by age. sex. and ethnicity to achieve a 2:1 control subjects/cases ratio. On multivariate analysis. prior radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for both men (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1) and women (OR = 2.3). Among women. higher educational attainment (OR = 2.4). alcohol use (OR = 2.0). and hairdye use (OR = 2.5) were also significantly associated with risk. There were no significant differences between cases and control subjects with respect to tobacco exposure or specific occupational or leisure-time exposures. There is biological plausibility for associations with hairdye use and alcohol exposure.\n",

In the present study the clinical applicability of M-mode guided two-dimensional integrated backscatter imaging was defined in evaluation of 55 nonselected patients. The mean amplitude of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in normal segments (long-axis view) was as follows: basal septum. 4.2 +/- 1.3 dB (mean +/- SD; n = 27). mid-septum. 4.5 +/- 1.0 dB (n = 26). basal posterior. 4.8 +/- 1.0 dB (n = 30). and mid-posterior. 4.8 +/- 1.2 decibels (n = 27). The respective mean delay values (R wave to nadir) were as follows: 0.89 +/- 0.09. 0.84 +/- 0.09. 0.86 +/- 0.09. and 0.85 +/- 0.12. At least one cardiac cycle could be analyzed fully in 62% of patients. Limitations included technically difficult two-dimensional echocardiography. inadequate M-line orientation. technically remediable errors. or poor quality integrated backscatter images. In abnormal segments (n = 13) cyclic variation was reduced and delay was prolonged (1.2 +/- 1.1 dB and 1.21 +/- 1.1. respectively). Intraobserver and interobserver variability for amplitude measurements were modest. with respective correlation coefficients of r = 0.93; r = 0.72. The findings demonstrate that M-mode--assisted integrated backscatter is a practical approach for characterization of regional myocardial properties promptly and at the bedside in a large portion of patients with cardiac disease.\n",

Biventricular stroke volumes were measured in 10 normal subjects for validation of methods and differed by 2.8%. Reading errors were 3.7%. Signal quality improved between the first and last observation (p less than 0.05). Velocity signals were corrected for intercept angles. which averaged 12 and 19 degrees for right heart flows and 31 and 32 degrees for the left side of the heart in all subjects. Negative correlations occurred between intercept angles and the chronologic order in which the patients were studied for left (p = 0.02) and right (p = 0.05) flows. Mean flow areas varied 9% in the left ventricle and 20% in the right ventricle. Total variability for measuring flow determined from control values was 11% to 13%. When twice the variability was used as the detectable level of change. only exercise provoked real increases in biventricular flows in the majority of patients. We conclude that serial measurements of flow by Doppler echocardiographic methods had to exceed 20% to 25% to achieve significant change. Measuring intercept angle. resolving flow area. and learning are variables that need greater emphasis.\n",

Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position. The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm. grouped at 0.1 cm intervals. As the aortic root size enlarged. the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient. r = 0.75). At an aortic root size in the \"small normal\" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm. the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%. In the \"intermediate\" and \"top normal\" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm. the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%. With aortic root dilation. the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%. The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified. Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation. Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes. Throughout the range of aortic root sizes. mild aortic regurgitation predominated. We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the \"top normal\" size range. that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size. and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation.\n",

M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography could not reliably distinguish patients with severe aortic stenosis from those with milder obstructions. The hemodynamic information offered by Doppler complemented echocardiographic imaging and provided an alternative modality for evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis. By application of the modified Bernoulli equation. the pressure gradient across the stenotic aortic valve could be estimated by Doppler echocardiography. Though helpful and widely used. the information provided by the pressure gradient across the valve about the severity of the obstruction was not complete.

A2 was effectively synchronous with the aortic artefact. However. when the onset of Doppler flow was regarded as the end of isovolumic relaxation. the interval was significantly longer than when mitral cusp separation on M mode echograms was used: by 25 (10) ms in healthy individuals. by 25 (15) ms in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. and by 50 (35) ms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with mitral stenosis the interval was only 5 (5) ms longer. The mitral valve opening artefact consistently followed the onset of flow and corresponded much more closely to the E point on the M mode echogram. This shows that it occurred during the rapid filling period and well beyond isovolumic relaxation by any definition. Thus isovolumic relaxation time measured from A2 to the onset of transmitral flow or the mitral valve opening artefact differs from that derived from A2 to mitral valve cusp separation.

TGF-beta 1 suppressed the production of IL-6 in normal bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and the production of IL-6 and GM-CSF in leukemic cells cultured with IL-1 alpha or LPS. The suppression of IL-6 production can explain the suppression by TGF-beta 1 of the effects of IL-1 alpha and LPS that are mediated by IL-6. TGF-beta 1 also suppressed differentiation in clones of myeloid leukemic cells induced with differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and tumor necrosis factor. In different leukemic clones TGF-beta 1 suppressed or enhanced induction of differentiation with dexamethasone. The results show that TGF-beta 1 can selectively control the activity of different molecular regulators of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.\n",

         "A specific in vitro bioassay for measuring erythropoietin levels in human serum and plasma, The accurate measurement of biologically active erythropoietin (Ep) in human serum and plasma using present in vivo and in vitro bioassays is difficult because of the presence of both inhibitors and non-Ep stimulators of erythropoiesis. We have developed a simple procedure to quantitatively purify Ep from serum and plasma for subsequent testing in the phenylhydrazine-treated mouse spleen cell assay. The method involves absorption of Ep to an immobilized high-affinity anti-Ep monoclonal antibody and acid elution of the antibody-bound material. After neutralization. the eluted EP is then tested directly in the in vitro bioassay without interference by other serum proteins. By using magnetic beads as a solid support for the antibody. washing and elution steps can be performed rapidly and efficiently. Recoveries of Ep after this procedure show very little sample-to-sample variation and are consistently between 45% and 55%. which is close to the maximum binding expected for the anti-Ep antibody. Coupled with the 7.4-fold concentration that this procedure affords. there is an overall increase in sensitivity of three- to fourfold. which makes this assay suitable for accurately measuring Ep levels in patients with below-average titers. Results with this magnetic bead assay indicate that accurate and reproducible estimates for Ep levels in the serum and plasma from healthy donors as well as from patients with hematologic disorders can be obtained. Titers of biologically active Ep in the sera from a group of patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were found to be elevated. and the values correlated well with titers of immunoreactive Ep measured in the Ep radioimmunoassay. Because of its specificity and high sensitivity. the magnetic bead assay is a valuable alternative to immunoassays for the measurement of elevated. normal. and even subnormal Ep levels in human serum and plasma.\n",

         "Induction of mixed erythroid-megakaryocyte colonies and bipotential blast cell colonies by recombinant human erythropoietin in serum-free culture, The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rEp) on murine hematopoietic progenitors were studied using a serum-free culture. A high concentration of rEp stimulated the formation of mixed erythroid-megakaryocyte colonies (EM colonies) and blast cell colonies. as well as erythroid colonies. erythroid bursts. and megakaryocyte colonies from normal mouse bone marrow cells. Direct effects of rEp on EM colony. megakaryocyte colony. and erythroid burst formation were confirmed by depletion of accessory cells such as T cells. B cells. and macrophages from crude bone marrow cells. and inhibition of the colonies by the addition of rabbit anti-rEp antibody to the culture in a dose-dependent fashion. Replating experiments were performed to confirm the differentiating ability of blast cell colonies grown in the presence of rEp. Most of the blast cell colonies yielded not only secondary erythroid colonies but also megakaryocyte colonies in the presence of 2 IU/mL rEp. Some of the blast cell colonies produced secondary EM colonies in the presence of 16 IU/ml rEp of 2 IU/mL rEp plus interleukin-3. although no granulocyte-macrophage colonies were found in the secondary culture. These results suggest that Ep acts not only as a late-acting factor that is specific for erythroid progenitors. but also as a bipotential EM-stimulating factor for murine hematopoietic cells.\n",

         "Uremic platelets have a functional defect affecting the interaction of von Willebrand factor with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, Uremic patients have an impaired platelet function that has been related to membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities. Using a perfusion system. we have studied the interaction of normal and uremic platelets with vessel subendothelium (SE) under flow conditions. Reconstituted blood containing washed platelets. purified von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1 U/mL). and normal washed red blood cells was exposed to de-endothelialized rabbit segments for 10 minutes at two different shear rates (800 and 1.600 seconds-1). In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates. With normal platelets. the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1.600 seconds-1. Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE. EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets. The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface. These data indicate that. under flow conditions. the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen. Under the same experimental conditions. the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets). The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets. These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients. Furthermore. they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa. The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients.\n",

         "Distinct characteristics of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells derived from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). A factor in B-CLL serum promotes natural killer cell-like LAK cell growth, We show that lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell precursors derived from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and cultured in the presence of recombinant interleukin-2 and normal human serum (NHS). develop into primarily NK cell-like (CD 57+) LAK cells. whereas identically prepared LAK cell precursors from normal subjects develop into mainly T cell-like (CD 3+. CD 8+) LAK cells. B-CLL LAK cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity than did normal LAK cells. When normal LAK cells were grown in B-CLL serum instead of NHS. their proliferation increased; NK cell levels also increased to those found in B-CLL LAK cells. suggesting that B-CLL serum contains a factor that promotes NK cell-like growth. LAK cells derived from normal or B-CLL patients demonstrated similar lytic activity toward K562 and Raji cells. Growth in B-CLL serum did not reduce their lytic potential. Thus. the altered phenotype and growth exhibited by B-CLL LAK cells and normal LAK cells grown in B-CLL serum does not lead to abnormalities in their cytolytic functions. We propose instead that the predominance of NK-like cells in B-CLL LAK cell populations and the presence of an NK cell-like growth factor in B-CLL serum reflect abnormalities related to NK cell-mediated B-cell regulation; ie. either inhibition of normal B-cell growth and/or growth stimulation of the leukemic clone in B-CLL.\n",

         "Transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, In 1.814 patients with sickle cell disease who had been transfused. the overall rate of alloimmunization to erythrocyte antigens was 18.6%. The rate of alloimmunization in this group appears to be an explicit function of the number of transfusions received because it increases exponentially with increasing numbers of transfusions. Alloimmunization usually occurred with less than 15 transfusions. although the rate of alloimmunization continued to increase when more transfusions were given. The rate of alloimmunization was less in patients with hemoglobin SC disease and sickle-beta+ thalassemia because these patients had received fewer transfusions. Children less than 10 years old had a slightly lower rate of alloimmunization than patients in other age groups even after correction for the number of transfusions given. Women were more frequently alloimmunized than men; this was largely due to the fact that women received more transfusions than men. but in the age group 16 to 20 years the increase may have been due in part to alloimmunization owing to pregnancy. Forty-five percent of those alloimmunized made antibodies of only one specificity; 17% made four or more antibodies reacting with different antigens. Antibodies to the C and E antigens of the Rh group. the Kell antigen. and the Lewis antigens were most commonly made. These findings may be important in formulating a rational transfusion policy in sickle cell disease.\n",

         "Coordinate secretion of interleukin-1 beta and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by the blast cells of acute myeloblastic leukemia: role of interleukin-1 as an endogenous inducer, Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) blasts have been shown to produce a variety of cytokines in culture such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-6. granulocyte-. macrophage-. and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). Using two sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for IL-1 beta and GM-CSF. we document in the present study that the production of the two cytokines by AML blasts in culture is coordinated. First. we observe a striking correlation between the levels of GM-CSF and IL-1 beta released by the cells. Thus. a high production of IL-1 beta is always concordant with a high production of GM-CSF and. conversely. low production of IL-1 beta is concordant with low levels of GM-CSF. Second. neutralization of intrinsic IL-1 using antibodies that are specific for IL-1 alpha and -1 beta suppresses the release of GM-CSF by the cells. Third. neutralization of the endogenous source of IL-1 also results in an abrogation of GM-CSF mRNA. Fourth. the production of both IL-1 beta and GM-CSF is up-regulated by exposing AML blasts to an exogenous source of IL-1. suggesting a positive regulation of autocrine growth factor production. Taken together. our results indicate that GM-CSF production by AML blasts is mediated by endogenously produced IL-1. Both IL-1 beta and -1 alpha are produced by AML blasts. although IL-1 beta appears to be more abundant. Spontaneous colony formation by AML blasts is abrogated by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL-1 beta and GM-CSF. whereas each antibody alone has little effect on blast proliferation. Taken together. our results are consistent with the view that the production of IL-1 beta by AML blasts supports autocrine growth in culture. through induction of CSFs or other cytokines that stimulate blast proliferation.\n",

As assessed by an immunologic assay specific for human PAI-1. guanidine HCI activated HT1080 PAI-1 and rPAI-1 entered the total plasma volume following intravenous bolus administration and exhibited a biphasic clearance pattern. The t1/2s of HT1080 PAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 6.0 and 24.8 minutes. respectively. The t1/2s of rPAI-1 for the initial and beta phases equalled 8.8 and 34.0 minutes. respectively. Similar results were obtained by measuring PAI-1 activity in plasma and with trace amounts of 125I-rPAI-1. suggesting that the above pharmacokinetic behavior could also apply to endogenous PAI-1. The liver was the main site of rPAI-1 clearance. Unactivated. latent PAI-1 exhibited a very different pharmacokinetic profile. Over 80% of latent rPAI-1 cleared from the circulation within 10 minutes (t1/2 = 1.7 minutes). The difference in clearance behavior between activated and latent PAI-1 may be related to the ability of activated PAI-1. but not latent PAI-1. to rapidly form high-molecular-weight complexes with plasma binding factors which were observed in vitro and in vivo. Because PAI-1 could potentially tilt the fibrinolytic balance toward a prothrombotic state. its rapid clearance may represent an important control mechanism governing the circulating levels of this key component of the fibrinolytic pathway.\n",

Infusion of thromboplastin into the rabbit caused a rapid increase of radioactivity over the lungs. possibly due to the accumulation of 125I fibrin in the lungs. followed by a rapid decline of radioactivity. suggestive of removal of fibrin from the lungs. Thromboplastin also caused a rapid decrease of systemic fibrinogen that was accompanied by a lengthening of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. The effect of coinfusion of rLACI with thromboplastin or bolus injection of rLACI before thromboplastin infusion was studied. At a high dose of rLACI (800 micrograms/kg body weight). the thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase in the lungs and the systemic fibrinogen decrease were completely suppressed. The activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time of the plasma samples lengthened. possibly due to the presence of thromboplastin in circulation. The thromboplastin-induced radioactivity increase over the lungs was not completely suppressed by lower doses of rLACI (135 to 270 micrograms/kg body weight). but these doses of rLACI prevented systemic fibrinogen decrease. At a bolus dose of 23 micrograms/kg body weight. rLACI provided 50% protection of the fibrinogen consumption (fibrinogen decreased to 82% compared with 65% in rabbits treated with thromboplastin alone). These results show that rLACI is effective in the inhibition of thromboplastin-induced coagulation in vivo.\n",

         "The role of cellular maturation in neutrophil heterogeneity, Previous studies have shown that many neutrophil (PMN) characteristics are heterogeneous but the origin of PMN heterogeneity is unknown. It is unclear if PMN functional heterogeneity is secondary to maturational differences or due to distinct subpopulations of cells that possess different functional capacities. The PMN 31D8 antigen is a useful probe for evaluation of PMN subpopulations. The majority of PMNs (approximately 85%) exhibit a high intensity fluorescence after 31D8 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) labeling (31D8 enriched or \"bright\" PMNs) as determined by flow cytometric analysis. These cells are more functional than cells with low intensity fluorescence (31D8 diminished or \"dull\" PMNs). Various immunologic. clonogenic and functional techniques were used to study the expression of the 31D8 antigen in HL-60 cells and myeloid cells in order to evaluate antigenic and functional heterogeneity during morphologic maturation. The results of this study indicate that the percentage of 31D8 antigen positive (31D8 antigen enriched and diminished) bone marrow cells increases from 20 +/- 11% in myeloblast cells to 68 +/- 10% in promyelocytes. 93 +/- 2% in myelocytes and 99 +/- 1% in bands and PMNs. 31D8 antigen enriched cells first appear at the myelocyte stage (32 +/- 10%) and increase in bands (52 +/- 13%). marrow PMNs (62 +/- 13%) and peripheral blood PMNs (88 +/- 4%). These data indicate that the heterogeneous expression of 31D8 antigen in PMNs is due. at least in part. to maturational differences within the PMN population and raise the possibility that other heterogeneously expressed PMN characteristics are also maturationally derived. They also suggest that 31D8 antigenic expression may be a more precise indicator of myeloid functional maturation than maturation as identified by cellular morphology.\n",
