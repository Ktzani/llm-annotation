We report on six ectopics that occurred in 141 IVF-ET pregnancies (4.3%). All of the six cases were among 84 patients with tubal disease. and none occurred in the remaining 57 patients with other etiological factors. No correlation was found in other parameters including: ovulation induction. number of embryos transferred. and luteal support. A comparison between the ectopics and six matched controls demonstrated similar estradiol levels. but beta-hCG levels on day 15 to 17 after ET were lower. Homolateral salpingectomy was performed in all six cases. but a contralateral resection was carried out in three of them. More comprehensive studies are needed to clarify whether tubal pathology really increases the risk for ectopic gestation in IVF-ET.\n",

We need to know how mutant CFTR expression leads to the relentless lung disease that takes the lives of the patients. We need to know how the different mutations in CFTR behave functionally. Much more information is needed on the pathways for ion transport in the airways in order for us to consider therapeutic alternatives. Better information on CFTR expression. particularly in the lung. would greatly facilitate consideration of pathophysiology as well as gene therapy. Many of these questions can be attacked by imaginative use of the tools already in hand. The need is urgent. The wondrous scientific advancements of the last five years and the additional money being spent on CF research have bought no dramatic increase in life expectancy for the patients.

         "Lung scanning for pulmonary embolism: clinical and pulmonary angiographic correlations, A group of 78 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism was studied by both ventilation perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary angiography. Symptoms and clinical signs were analysed using Bayesian techniques to produce pre-test odds for pulmonary embolism in individual patients. While. as a group. those with embolism could be discriminated from those without on this basis. major overlap existed between the groups. invalidating the use of this approach for individual patients. Strict diagnostic criteria for interpretation of lung scans were accurate using pulmonary angiography as the 'gold standard'. but at the expense of a significant number of patients (38 per cent) in the indeterminate (non-diagnostic) group. In the 48 patients in whom the test yielded a diagnostic result. there was a sensitivity of 100 per cent (15/15) and a specificity of 97 per cent (32/33). In the series as a whole. the likelihood of lung scanning correctly diagnosing pulmonary embolism was 55 per cent (15/27) and of correctly excluding embolism. 63 per cent (32/51). By the use of strict criteria for interpretation of lung scanning. reliable information can be obtained on the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism in a large proportion of patients suspected of having the condition. Such information is more discriminating than clinical signs and symptoms.\n",

Patients reported significantly more frequent. more recent. and more normal smears than were documented in medical records. The interval between onset of cancer symptoms and previous smear correlated directly with advanced stage. Sixteen women with normal smears within 36 months had significantly more advanced cancers than did 25 women with recent abnormal smears. Women with recent normal and abnormal smears had similar sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Because of inaccuracies in patients' self-reported smear histories and cancers developing in women with recent normal smears. we conclude that a specific screening interval should not be relied upon.\n",

         "Intractable epilepsy and structural lesions of the brain: mapping, resection strategies, and seizure outcome, Forty-seven patients with structural brain lesions on neuroimaging studies and partial epilepsy intractable to medical therapy were studied. Prolonged noninvasive interictal and ictal EEG recording was performed. followed by more focused mapping using chronically implanted subdural electrode plates. Surgical procedures included lesion biopsy. maximal lesion excision. and/or resection of zones of epileptogenesis depending on accessibility and involvement of speech or other functional areas. The epileptogenic zone involved exclusively the region adjacent to the structural lesion in 11 patients. It extended beyond the lesion in 18 patients. Eighteen other patients had remote noncontiguous zones of epileptogenesis. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 17 of 18 patients (94%) with complete lesion excision regardless of extent of seizure focus excision. Postoperative control of epilepsy was accomplished in 5 of 6 patients (83%) with incomplete lesion excision but complete seizure focus excision and in 12 of 23 patients (52%) with incomplete lesion excision and incomplete focus excision. The extent of lesion resection was strongly associated with surgical outcome either in itself (p less than 0.003). or in combination with focus excision. Focus resection was marginally associated with surgical outcome as a dichotomous variable (p = 0.048) and showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.07) only as a three-level outcome variable. We conclude that structural lesions are associated with zones of epileptogenesis in neighboring and remote areas of the brain. Maximum resection of the lesion offers the best chance at controlling intractable epilepsy; however. seizure control is achieved in many patients by carefully planned subtotal resection of lesions or foci.\n",

Eleven subjects experienced the onset of symptoms with an acute illness (seven Monospot-positive). Medical history. physical examination. and laboratory testing yielded little helpful information. Serologic testing for Coxsackie B viruses 1 through 6. cytomegalovirus. Epstein-Barr virus. human herpesvirus 6. and Toxoplasma gondii in subjects and healthy controls provided little evidence for an infectious cause of persistent fatigue. Children's Depression Inventory scores and psychiatric interviews with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Children's Version (K-SADS) identified five subjects with major depression. On the K-SADS. the 10 fatigued subjects without major depression endorsed many secondary symptoms of depression but were less likely than depressed psychiatric clinic patients to endorse primary symptoms such as depressed mood. guilt. and suicidality. At telephone follow-up 13 to 32 months after intake. 4 subjects were completely well. 4 markedly improved. and 7 unimproved or worse. Further research is necessary to determine whether chronic fatigue in adolescents is prodromal depression. a discrete psychosomatic condition. or an infectious or immunologic disorder that mimics depression.\n",

         "Overview of hemochromatosis, Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that occurs with high prevalence in populations of European origin. The gene that is abnormal in hemochromatosis is found on the short arm of chromosome 6 in close proximity (approximately 1 centimorgan) to HLA-A. but the product coded for by that gene is unknown. The pathogenetic mechanism in hemochromatosis is that of continued. excessive absorption of dietary iron with loss of normal control mechanisms. leading to a gradual but vast expansion of storage iron as ferritin and especially as hemosiderin. Through mechanisms that probably include peroxidation of lipid membranes. the excess iron injures hepatocytes. islet B cells. gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary. myocardium. synovial cells. and chondrocytes. and probably other cells and tissues as well. Most patients with hemochromatosis remain undiagnosed throughout life. Removal of the excess iron by phlebotomy will prevent all of the complications of hemochromatosis when begun early and will significantly improve survival in virtually all patients. It is important. therefore. that the diagnosis of hemochromatosis be considered much more frequently in clinical medicine in order that this effective therapy be utilized.\n",

The adjacent vertebrae were transfixed by two 3-mm Steinman pins placed vertically. These were applied in five different positions: between the anterior vertebral bodies. posterior vertebral bodies. pedicles. transverse processes. and lamina. Rotational displacement was limited the most by transfixation between the vertebral bodies (position one or two). Disrupting the anulus fibrosus significantly increased rotation in all positions except those in the vertebral body. These findings may imply that spinal fixation devices that engage the vertebral bodies may offer inherent advantages over purely posterior devices in stabilizing a vertebral motion segment. In addition. an interbody arthrodesis may prevent intervertebral motion better than a posterior or posterolateral fusion.\n",

         "Prognostic value of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in gastric carcinoma, A new monoclonal antibody to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PC10. which can be used on routinely processed tissue. was applied to 93 cases of gastric carcinoma. Significant intra-tumoural variation in staining occurred. In addition to a PCNA index (percentage of positive cells per 1000 tumour cells). a semiquantitative PCNA grading system was devised. based on estimates of less than or more than 50% of positive tumour cells in whole sections. Neither PCNA index nor PCNA grade showed any correlation with established histological variables. tumour stage. or the presence of lymph node metastases. No significant correlation was observed between PCNA index and S + G2M phase fraction measured by flow cytometric analysis. To analyse survival tumours with PCNA indices above and below the median level (41%) were compared. Those with a higher index tended to have a worse prognosis. but when PCNA grade was considered. it was found to have definite independent prognostic value. tumours of low grade surviving better than those of high grade. The ability of semiquantitative PCNA grading to allow for intra-tumoural variation suggests it may have advantages over absolute counting. which is prone to sampling error when tumour heterogeneity is a major factor. The prognostic value of PC10 staining in gastric carcinoma is therefore promising.\n",

         "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a new endoscopic technique that has diffused throughout the surgical community with great rapidity. Although the DATTA panelists considered the procedure appropriate with respect to both its safety and effectiveness. recognition was made that there are no comparative trials of this technique vs open cholecystectomy and virtually no literature on complication rates. The Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons has developed minimal credentialing criteria for determining competence in laparoscopic surgery. This includes completion of an approved residency training in general surgery. training in laparoscopic technique either by a surgeon experienced in this procedure or by completion of an approved course in the technique requiring hands-on laboratory practice. and observation or proctoring of an actual surgical procedure. Many of the DATTA panelists (35 of 40 [87.5%]) reiterated the importance of requiring that the procedure be performed first with animals and that subsequent laparoscopic procedures on patients be done under the supervision of an expert in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n",

         "In situ hybridisation with digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes for detection of viral genomes, The applicability of a recently developed non-radioactive DNA labelling and detection method. which uses the digoxigenin (DIG) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. for the detection of viral infections in pathology specimens by in situ hybridisation. was examined. Its efficacy was compared with that of biotin and radioisotope labelling methods. Three cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. two of verruca vulgaris. and seven cases of laryngeal papilloma were studied. The sensitivity of the DIG labelled probe was almost the same as that of a 35S-labelled probe in the dot-blot hybridisation test. Using in situ hybridisation with 35S-labelled and DIG labelled probes. the levels of the hybridised signals detected were similar. The biotin labelled probe was less sensitive. particularly in the cases of laryngeal papilloma. The DIG labelling and detection method was highly sensitive and applicable to the detection of viral infection by ISH. and is preferable to a radiolabelled probe. especially when in situ hybridisation is done in the pathology laboratory.\n",

         "Effect of exogenous growth hormone on whole-body and isolated-limb protein kinetics in burned patients, The effect of growth hormone on protein kinetics was assessed in burned patients during the hyperdynamic phase using N15 lysine and balance data across the leg. Levels of resting energy expenditure and cardiac index were comparably elevated in all patients. but leg blood flow was greater in the patients receiving growth hormone. Growth hormone therapy (0.2 mg/kg per day) significantly stimulated protein synthesis in the whole body and in the studied leg. A hyperinsulinemic clamp. which raised the insulin concentration to more than 1435 pmol/L of blood. caused comparable stimulation of leg protein synthesis in patients not receiving growth hormone. but did not further increase protein synthesis in the growth hormone-treated patients. These results suggest that administration of exogenous growth hormone may limit the peripheral protein wasting in severely injured patients by a mechanism similar to that of insulin.\n",

         "Allergy to penicillin: fable or fact, OBJECTIVE--To assess whether. on the basis of one blood test. penicillin allergy might be excluded sufficiently for general practitioners to give oral penicillin to patients claiming a history of penicillin allergy. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients referred by general practitioners. SETTING--Outpatient allergy clinic in a district general hospital. PATIENTS--175 referred patients who gave a history of immediate type reaction to penicillin. of whom 144 attended as requested and 132 completed the investigations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History and examination. serum radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin. and oral challenge with penicillin. RESULTS--Of 132 patients. four were confirmed to have penicillin allergy by the radioallergosorbent test and 128 had an oral penicillin challenge without ill effect. CONCLUSIONS--Most patients who gave a history of penicillin allergy are not so allergic. and their actual allergic state should be substantiated whenever feasible. For patients reporting minor or vague reactions negative findings with a radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin provide sufficient evidence to give oral penicillin safely.\n",

         "The ocular effects of gases when injected into the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes, We studied the toxic effects of sulfur hexafluoride and perfluoropropane in comparison with air. balanced salt solution. hyaluronate sodium. and aqueous humor in a rabbit model. Sixty normal pigmented rabbits were studied during a period of 4 weeks. The variables studied were slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment. intraocular pressure as measured by pneumotonometry. corneal thickness and endothelial cell count as measured by specular microscopy. lens opacity by Scheimpflug photography. and light and transmission electron microscopy. All three gases were more toxic to the cornea and lens than were balanced salt solution. hyaluronate. and aqueous humor. However. 15% perfluoropropane and 50% sulfur hexafluoride were no more toxic to the eye than air was. Therefore. this study suggests that nonexpansile mixtures of perfluoropropane and sulfur hexafluoride may be beneficial and relatively safe in re-forming persistently flat anterior chambers in situations where the use of air is being considered.\n",

         "A randomized comparison of the nephrotoxicity of iopamidol and diatrizoate in high risk patients undergoing cardiac angiography, Three hundred seven high risk patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl) were randomized in a double-blind manner to either iopamidol (a nonionic. low osmolar radiocontrast agent) or diatrizoate (a conventional radiocontrast agent) at cardiac angiography with subsequent follow-up study of renal function. Baseline clinical and angiographic variables were similar in the iopamidol (n = 155) and diatrizoate (n = 152) groups. Change in renal function after angiography was less pronounced with iopamidol compared with diatrizoate as measured by mean ( +/- SD) increase in 24 h serum creatinine (0.11 +/- 0.2 versus 0.22 +/- 0.26 mg/dl. p less than 0.001). mean maximal increase in serum creatinine (0.2 +/- 0.44 versus 0.38 +/- 0.73 mg/dl. p less than 0.0001) and percent of patients with a maximal increase in serum creatinine greater than 0.5 mg/dl (8% versus 19%. p less than 0.01). Such differences could not be documented in diabetic patients using insulin. There was no significant difference between agents in the number of patients developing clinically severe acute renal dysfunction. It is concluded that iopamidol is less nephrotoxic than diatrizoate in high risk patients at cardiac angiography. However. the difference in nephrotoxicity is small. of no major clinical significance in the majority of high risk patients and could not be documented in insulin-using diabetic patients. Iopamidol may be the preferred agent in certain patients with advanced renal impairment. but further study is warranted.\n",

         "Soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall. Results of surgical resection, Primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall are uncommon. and data concerning treatment and results are sparse. Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis. To assess the results of surgical treatment. we reviewed our 40-year experience. Methods: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed. Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05. Results: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median. 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases. Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade. Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32. 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23. 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18. 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17. 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14. 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13. 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11. 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4. 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3. 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3. 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3. 3%); and other types (n = 12. 9%). Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%). Local recurrence developed in 27%. Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42. synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90. 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59. 10%). Overall 5-year survival was 66%. Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%. p less than 0.0001). Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic. Conclusions: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities. Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas. but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas.\n",

         "Periarticular heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. Risk factors and consequences, The formation of periarticular heterotopic bone after total hip arthroplasty is a frequent complication. The reported occurrences concerning this complication vary considerably in different reports. ranging from 15% to 90% with significant amounts in 1%-27% of the cases. Heterotopic ossification (HO) starts with the surgical operation. and the extent is well delineated on roentgenograms after six to 12 weeks. The amount of bone varies from small islands in the soft tissue to widespread bridging ossification. The cause of HO seems to be mainly related to systemic factors and is chiefly dependent on gender. diagnosis. and concurrent antiinflammatory medication. Patients at risk seem to be those with HO after a previous surgical operation. patients suffering from certain types of ankylosing spondylitis. otherwise healthy men with osteoarthrosis. patients with hypertrophic osteoarthrosis. and patients operated upon for fresh fractures or other posttraumatic conditions. The surgical technique and the local tissue trauma probably moderate both the occurrence and amount of HO. HO does not seem to cause pain or to decrease hip muscle strength but does limit hip mobility in cases with significant amount of ossification.\n",
